    <h1>Yuna Baby</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>Welcome to the digital memorial site for Yuna the Cat AKA Yuna Baby. Yuna was an awesome kitty who lived to the late age of 16. She loved food, let me tell ya, she was the biggest foodie. She had an old soul even from a young age. She would look at you the way your grandmom would look at you; a sweet but knowing look. Yuna also had a great sense of humor. If something funny would happen in a room that she shared with you, she would look at you for your reaction. Her looks would immediately make the situation funnier. She would lick her lips when she would watch anyone else eat, even if she had just eaten. She would comfort you if you were sad or feeling sick, it was like she was psychic or once human in another life. She was wise beyond her years and we miss her everyday. We know she's in heaven eating her heart's content in whatever you can imagine. RIP Yuna Baby, until we meet again.
