    <h1>Yuna Baby</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>Welcome to the digital memorial site for Yuna the Cat AKA Yuna Baby. Yuna was an awesome kitty who lived to the late age of 16. She loved food, she was the biggest foodie. She had an old soul even from a young age. She would look at you the way your grandmom would look at you, or anyone's grandmom for that matter. A sweet but knowing look. Yuna also had a great sense of humor. If something funny would happen in a room that she shared with you, she would look at you for your reaction. She would lick her lips when she would watch anyone else eat, even if she had just eaten. She was wise beyond her years and we miss her everyday. We know she's in heaven eating her heart's content in whatever you can imagine. RIP Yuna Baby, until we meet again.
