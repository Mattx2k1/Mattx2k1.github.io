            Hello! I'm <strong>Matt</strong> and learning to program has changed my world. No matter what anyone may tell you, it is possible to teach yourself programming. The thing to keep in mind is that no one is fully self taught in anything. We all learn from someone and through one another we get better and better at our crafts across generations. Learning to program gave me a unqiue experience where I could learn something I was genuinely interested in while also having a new language to communicate ideas and thoughts to peers. It was a new way to communicate with others on a technical level. It all started with simple interests as a teenager. I was on Black Planet and Myspace; learning how to put music on my page, adding GIFs and images to my profile were just a few things I learned with HTML. 
            
            After nearly a decade, I found my way back into tech. Free resources were monunmental in my learning to code. I started on Youtube and then CodeAcademy. Next I went to Sololearn, which is where I felt learning as a beginner was the easiest. I began with Python 3, and decided to go back and learn relearn both HTML and CSS; which is now HTNL5 and CSS3. It was a needed refresher for because back in middle school I would build websites on Angelfire, Geocities, and Homestead. I remember using Mozilla Web-Based Documentation, which I learned a lot of syntax from.

            From 2015 to current, I have been learning something technology related, every day. Programming languages, platforms and web based tools, I have been learning about it. Technology has always interested me and learning to program is something I really enjoy. I am a creative and curious person, learning to build/create things as well as fix them is indeed a passion of mine. Part of my time off from tech was learning, writing, and playing music. I think this lends to my creativity.
