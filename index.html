        <p>
             Hello! I'm <strong>Matt</strong> and I like to develop software. Learning to program gave me a unqiue experience where I could learn something I was genuinely interested in while also having a new language to communicate ideas and thoughts to peers. It was a new way to communicate with others on a technical level and through a digital medium. It all started with simple interests as a teenager. I was on Black Planet and Myspace; learning how to put music on my page, adding GIFs and images to my profile were just a few things I learned with HTML. <br><br>
            
            After nearly a decade, I found my way back into tech. Free resources were monunmental in my learning to code. I started on Youtube and then began doing some lessons on CodeAcademy. Next I went to Sololearn, which is where I felt learning as a beginner was the easiest. I began with Python 3, and decided to go back and learn relearn both HTML and CSS; which is now HTNL5 and CSS3. It was a needed refresher because back in middle school I would build websites on Angelfire, Geocities, and Homestead. I remember using Mozilla Web-Based Documentation, which I learned a lot of syntax from. HTML and CSS have changed a bit since my early days with them, but I know this foundational knowldge stuck with me, and helped me re-learn it faster.<br><br>

            From 2015 to current, I have been learning something technology related, every day. Programming languages, platforms and web based tools, I have been learning about it. Technology has always interested me and learning to program is something I really enjoy. I am a creative and curious person, learning to build/create things as well as fix them is indeed a passion of mine. Part of my time off from tech was learning, writing, and playing music. I think this lends to my creativity and resourcefulness when I am solving a problem or building a project.<br><br>

            One of my favorite experiences in Tech so far has been the Coding Bootcamp I attended; LaunchCode's (formerly known as) "LC101 - JavaScript & Java Web Development Course". This course is now called, "Part Time Web Dev". It was here where I got to work collaboratively with other students. This was one of the toughest things I ever did, I learned a ton of new technologies and had to build projects while working full time. I was already in Tech, but programming was not in the scope of that role. Graduating this course was one of the most amazing feelings I have experienced, because I always wanted to be a programmer. We did real projects, we had to solve problems collaboratively, we built front-end pages that worked with back-end code and databases. I felt my hard work pay off as I not only completed the course but also landed an opportunity just before graduating.<br><br>

            I have continued learning on my own and through work but I have learned I really enjoy structured learning environments. I find it easier to focus in isolation, but when working with others, a lot more ideas float around. Open discussions also foster new learning. I learned about new technology and practices I would have missed for years in isolation. Learning in Tech never ends. It can be overwhelming at times but learning is something that I enjoy doing. Pairing that love with my afinity for technology, and it is an obvious match.<br><br>

            My latest development journey is through Meta's Front-End Developer course. I am still working full-time so the self-paced nature of this course fits well with my current life demands. I did already learn Front-End Development in the LC101 Coding Bootcamp, but I am someone who loves continued learning, and seeing different perspectives, so I was intrigued to check out the program. So far it has been really good, with the information neatly presented in a engaging way that feels easy to retain. My early tech background, Coding Bootcamp experience, and current full-time role, have given me a huge base of knowledge to grow from. Taking this course will add a few more tools to my backpack. <br><br>

            Please stay tuned, I plan on using my new skills to update this page. More updates coming soon!
