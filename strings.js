// Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would
// see:

// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
console.log(myStr); // not sure I needed this but I think it works to print IRL
